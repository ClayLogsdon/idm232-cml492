<div class="description-box">


<p class="description">Kibbeh, a form of the Arabic word kubbah or "ball," is a staple in Middle 
    Eastern cuisine. Made out of <br> lamb or beef, these football-shaped croquettes are a flavorful 
    blend of fragrant herbs and spices, <br>filling meat, and hearty bulgur wheat.</p>

<h3 class="instructions-title">Cooking Instructions</h3>


<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>
        Soak the bulgur wheat in enough water to cover and set aside
    </li>
    <li>
        To make the filling, sauté the chopped onions in regular olive oil until golden on medium low heat
        <li>  
        Add 500g of minced meat to the onions and cook out the meat on medium high heat
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the 7 spice, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt and use the back of your wooden spoon to break up the meat
        </li>
        <li>
            When it is cooked turn off the heat and add the sumac and chopped walnuts. Taste to make any adjustments then cover and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the bulgur wheat and add to a large bowl. Take out the kilo of meat and prepare food processor
        </li>
        <li>
            In several batches, add the bulgur wheat and equal amounts of meat to the food processor and process until it clumps together and starts to roll in the processor bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roughly chop 2 onions to go in the food processor along with the 7 spices, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt. Blitz well
        </li>
        <li>
            When you have combined all the meat and bulgur wheat in a bowl, add the blitzed onion spice mix and the cornflour, then bring everything together preferably with your hands
        </li>
    <li>
        If it is too dry add a bit of water, you don't want it too loose, sticky or crumbly but so it holds together nicely. If you don't mind tasting a bit of raw meat check a tiny bit for saltiness and adjust as necessary
    </li>
    <li>
        Add approx half a cup of sunflower to a small bowl which you can dip your fingers into when shaping the kibbeh to avoid sticking. Clean your table and arrange a workflow with a large clean tray, the sunflower oil, the filling and the casing mix
    </li>
    <li>
        Take some casing and roll into golf ball size, indent the middle then hollow out the inside with your index finger turning as you do so until you have a half shell. Add a spoon of filling and close up the casing. Compress well with your hands and shape into classic kibbeh morsels (see video)
    </li>
    <li>
        Line up the kibbeh on the tray until you finish the filling
       
    </li>
    <li>
        Deep fry your kibbeh morsels in sunflower or vegetable oil and serve with yoghurt dip
    </li>
        </ul>
